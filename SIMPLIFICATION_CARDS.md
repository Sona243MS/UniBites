# 📉 Simplification Update: Removed Budget Cards

## Change
I have removed the following summary cards from the **Daily Meal Planner** section on the Dashboard:
1.  **Budget Per Meal**
2.  **Projected Savings**

## Result
The "Today's Meal Plan" section is now streamlined, focusing purely on:
- The Meal Slots (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner)
- Selecting your food items.

This greatly reduces visual noise for a cleaner planning experience.
