## 🍽️ Smart Meal Planner - How It Works

### **Step 1: Understanding Your Budget**

When you open the dashboard, the planner shows:

**Money Left Today:**
- Large number at top right
- This is how much you can spend today

**Budget Per Meal:**
- Divides your daily budget by 4 meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner)
- Example: If you have ₹200 left and 4 meals = ₹50 per meal

**If You Follow This Plan:**
- Shows if you'll save or overspend
- Updates as you select meals

---

### **Step 2: Getting Smart Recommendations** 💡

For each meal, the planner shows **"💡 Recommended for You"** suggestions:

**How Recommendations Work:**

1. **Analyzes Your Budget**
   - Looks at how much you have left
   - Considers how many meals remaining
   - Checks your savings progress

2. **Suggests Best Options**
   - **"Best Value"**: Perfect balance of price and quality (4.5+ stars)
   - **"Treat Yourself"**: Premium options (only if you're ahead on savings)
   - Shows price and reason for each suggestion

3. **Smart Filtering**
   - Only shows meals from your selected canteen
   - Prioritizes affordable options
   - Considers meal ratings

**Example:**
```
💡 Recommended for You

Masala Dosa                    ₹60
Perfect balance of value and quality (4.8★)
[Best Value]

Veg Thali                      ₹80
Great value at ₹80 (4.5★)
```

### **Step 3: Selecting Your Meals**

**Option 2: Choose from Dropdown**

---

### **Step 4: Understanding the Summary**

At the bottom, you see **"📊 Your Plan Summary"**:

**Total you'll spend:**
- Sum of all selected meals
- Example: ₹60 + ₹80 + ₹30 + ₹90 = ₹260

**You'll save/overspend:**
- Compares to your daily limit
- Example: Daily limit ₹200, spending ₹180 = Save ₹20 ✓
- Example: Daily limit ₹200, spending ₹220 = Over ₹20 ⚠

**Smart Tips:**
- If overspending: "💡 Try choosing cheaper options or skip a meal"

### **Budget Redistribution - The Smart Part!** 🧠

**Example Scenario:**

**Day 1:**
- Daily limit: ₹200
- You spent: ₹150
- Saved: ₹50

**Day 2:**
- System takes your ₹50 savings
- Divides by remaining days (let's say 29 days)
- ₹50 ÷ 29 = ₹1.72 per day
- **New daily limit: ₹201.72**

**If You Overspend:**

**Day 1:**
- Daily limit: ₹200
- You spent: ₹250
- Overspent: -₹50

**Day 2:**
- System takes your -₹50 overspending
- Divides by remaining days (29 days)
- -₹50 ÷ 29 = -₹1.72 per day
- **New daily limit: ₹198.28**

**Key Point:** The system ensures you stay on track for your monthly goal!

## 💰 Monthly Savings Goal Tracking

### **How It Works:**

**Setup:**
- You set a monthly savings goal (e.g., ₹500)
- System calculates daily budget to achieve this

**Tracking:**

🎉 Great! You're meeting your savings goal!
```
