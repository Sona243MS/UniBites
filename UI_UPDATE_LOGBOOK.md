# 🥨 UI Update: Log Book Rename

## Change
Renamed the generic **"Log items"** section header to **"Snacks"**.

## Reasoning
- The generic bucket captures miscellaneous items and those from the "Snacks" slot.
- Items like **Samosa**, Coffee, Puffs, etc., typically appear here.
- "Snacks" is a much more descriptive and accurate label for this category.

## File Modified
- `app/student/logbook/page.tsx`

## Result
The Log Book now categorizes your day as:
1. Breakfast
2. Lunch
3. Snacks (Previously "Log items")
4. Dinner

This matches the intuitive way users think about their food intake.
