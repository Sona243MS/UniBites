🍽️ **Best Value Picks:**

### **Example 3: Feature Question**

**You:** "How does meal skipping work?"

**AI Compass:**
"Great question! Here's how meal skipping works:

**What Happens:**
1. Click the 'Skip' button on any meal in the planner
2. Your budget automatically redistributes to other meals

**Example:**
- Daily budget: ₹200 for 4 meals = ₹50 each
- Skip breakfast → ₹200 for 3 meals = ₹66.67 each
- More money for lunch, snacks, and dinner!

**When to Skip:**
✓ Not hungry for that meal
✓ Eating out with friends
✓ Want to save money
✓ Intermittent fasting

You can undo a skip anytime by clicking 'Undo Skip'. Want to try it?"
