# 🎫 Mess Pass Compatibility Upgrade

## ✅ Feature Update
Students with an active **Mess Pass** can now track **extra expenses** seamlessly.

### Changes Made
1.  **Dual View Dashboard**:
    - When a Mess Pass is active, the Dashboard now shows **Two Cards**:
        1.  **Mess Pass Status**: Shows validity dates.
        2.  **Extra Budget**: Shows your daily allowance for snacks/extras.
    - Previously, the budget cards were hidden entirely.

2.  **Updated Logic**:
    - The "Daily Budget" card automatically renames itself to "**Extra Budget**" when a pass is active.
    - Spending on snacks (logged via Meal Planner or Log Book) will deduct from this extra budget, letting you track "Pocket Money" separate from your Mess Pass meals.

3.  **Clearer Instructions**:
    - The Mess Pass card now explicitly says: *"Use Log Book to track extra snacks or expenses."*

## 🚀 Status

**Test**: Apply a Mess Pass and see the new "Extra Budget" card appear next to it!
